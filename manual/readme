# MyShell User Manual-Isabelle O'Keeffe

## Introduction
Welcome to MyShell, a miniature shell program inspired by traditional Unix shells. 
MyShell provides a command-line interface for executing commands and managing your system. 
This manual serves as a guide to help you understand MyShell's operation, commands, environment concepts, I/O redirection and process management.
PLEASE NOTE: Upon making and running the shell there are two error messages, the shell still works despite these! 
## Operation and Commands
MyShell operates by accepting user input and executing commands. Here's an overview of the available commands:

- **cd**: Change the current working directory.
- **clr**: Clear the screen.
- **dir**: List the contents of a directory.
- **environ**: Display the current environment variables.
- **echo**: Display a message on the screen.
- **help**: Display the user manual.
- **pause**: Pause the shell until Enter is pressed.
- **quit**: Exit the shell.

## Environment Concepts
MyShell maintains an environment similar to traditional Unix shells. Key environment concepts include:

- **Environment Variables**: MyShell uses environment variables like `PATH` and `PWD` to configure its behavior.
- **Working Directory**: The working directory, displayed in the prompt, determines the location for command execution.

## I/O Redirection
MyShell supports I/O redirection to manage command input and output effectively.

- **Input Redirection (`<`)**: Redirects input from a file to a command.
- **Output Redirection (`>` and `>>`)**: Redirects command output to a file.

## Process Concept and Execution
MyShell manages processes, allowing commands to execute in either foreground or background mode. Here are the key differences:

- **Foreground Execution**: Commands executed in the foreground interact directly with the user and occupy the shell until completion.
- **Background Execution**: Commands executed in the background allow the shell to continue accepting input while the command runs asynchronously.

##NOTE:
Run the shell by typing ./bin/myshell
.gitkeep files are a new concept I learned from this project, they allow you to track and push empty directories such as bin!
