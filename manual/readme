# MyShell User Manual

## Introduction
MyShell is a simple UNIX-like shell program designed to provide users with a command-line interface for executing commands and managing their system.

## Installation
To install MyShell, clone the repository and compile the source code using the provided Makefile.

## Basic Usage
- Run MyShell by executing the `myshell` executable.
- Enter commands at the prompt and press Enter to execute them.

## Environment Concepts
- **Environment Variables**: MyShell utilizes environment variables such as `PATH` and `PWD` to manage the shell's environment.
- **Working Directory**: The current working directory is displayed in the shell prompt and can be changed using the `cd` command.

## I/O Redirection
- Input redirection (`<`) allows redirecting input from a file to a command.
- Output redirection (`>` and `>>`) allows redirecting command output to a file.

## Background Execution
- To run a command in the background, append `&` to the command.
- Background processes continue running even after the shell prompt is returned to the user.
